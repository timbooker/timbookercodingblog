Blog!
--- 

Put simply, I've been planning on getting started with blogging for a while. I occasionally come up with things that would be useful to more people than just me, generally get half a blog post written up, and leave it there. It's been this way for several years - and it's time for that to change. 

With that, let's get started with something sort-of-useful.

What is Simple.Data?
---

Simple.Data is a great micro-orm-ish thing, similar in a lot of ways to dapper / petapoco / etc, but with just a little bit more feature rich (ability to create linq-like dynamic queries that resolve to POCOs easily being the killer for me)

It has a few fustrating downers (that are soon to be resolved), but it's generally a great package for when you don't feel the need to use any of the heavier ORMs.
